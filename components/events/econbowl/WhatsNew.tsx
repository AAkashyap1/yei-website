            In a step-up from the previous two years, EconBowl participants can
            now sign up to compete in one of two competition tracks: Team or
            Individual. To ensure that all competitors are on a level playing
            field, teams will only be competing against teams, and individuals
            against individuals. Please keep in mind that you may only sign up
            for one of the two options (e.g. you cannot compete both in a team
            and individually). Separate prize pools have been established for
            each round!
